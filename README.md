# World Weather Analysis
module 6 challenge
## Goals
The goal of this project was to generate a random list of latitudes and longitudes and from that a list of cities. We use this list to generate weather data for these cities from open maps API and map these cities using google maps API. We even create a vacation itinerary to travel through 4 cities in the Philippines with directions and information on each city we're traveling to.
